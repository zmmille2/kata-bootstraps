# PRs

Welcome to the Pull Request Review code kata!
I'll provide links to the pull requests each group will need to review.

## Ground Rules

For now, let's establish some ground rules.
While in a perfect world, you wouldn't need these, we're in a vacuum here and I only have finite time (AFAIK), so I made some sacrifices.

### Don't worry about nits

I tried my best to not introduce any typos, syntax errors, etc.
Ideally, these would be caught by a pipeline.
I didn't set up pipelines for this.

### There's no tests ðŸ™ˆ

I wanted to emphasize that this is a skill you can do whether you know the language or not.
That means I wrote code in a few different languages.
As such, I didn't write tests for a lot of the code.

Feel free to call out "No tests" on the PRs.
If you have time, maybe comment what tests you'd expect!

### Don't hold back

Most code is paraphrased from [Head First Design Patterns](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-design/0596007124/).

I didn't write the book, so I don't really care if you really tear things apart.

## Recommended Reading

While I think you should read all of these, it might not be the best use of our time in this code kata to knock all these out.
